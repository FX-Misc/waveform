waveform
========
This is a browser-based GUI for working with extra-neuronal waveform data.

Daniel decided that browsers are good for rapid design of user-friendly interfaces. 
This is very much a work in progress. Note that only Chrome is actively supported.
Firefox seems to work okay, but other browsers less so.
