<!--
CUSTOM ELEMENT: cut-object
BY: DM

This is similar to rm-plots and friends, except that this element is not intended to be a singleton inside 
a tile-wall element.  Instead, there can be many cut-object elements, one for each cut the user has loaded.

The similarity with rm-plots is becuase the "groups" array of the tilewall should be bound
to this element's "groups" property.  Each element of the groups array has an inds value which
is an id for use with typed-array-manager.  This element provides various methods for splicing
and dicing the cut, with each action modifying one or more of the inds values in the groups array.

It also provides a pair of arrays called undo_stack and redo_stack.  They contain deltas, which
(may) include id's for use with typed-array-manager.
