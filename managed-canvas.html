CUSTOM ELEMENT: canvas-manager
BY: DM

polymer doesn't allow you to use dom elements within a property, so if you want a canvas to be
a part of a property you have to something more complicated...

Note that elements can only be inserted into the dom in one place, if you insert in multiple places,
only the element will only appear at the final location.

Use one of the following methods to create a new canvas:
    create_from_buffer(buffer, [dim_0, dim_1])
    create_from_dims([dim_0, dim_1])
They return an id for use with the following methods:
    get_canvas(id)
    get_2d_ctx(id)
    free_canvas(id)
Note you must free canvases when you no longer want them, otherwise there will be a memory leak.

You can use it as follows, note that canvas-manger must come before any managed-canvas elements.
The canvas-manger is a singleton, i.e. all instances share the same state:

    <canvas-manager></canvas-manager> 
    <managed-canvas></managed-canvas>
    <managed-canvas></managed-canvas>

    <script>
    var m = window.canvas_manager;
    var c_ids = [m.create_from_dims([100,150]), m.create_from_dims([100,20]), m.create_from_dims([20,100])];

    var els = document.getElementsByTagName('managed-canvas');
    els[0].canv_id = c_ids[0];
    els[1].canv_id = c_ids[1];

    var ctx = m.get_2d_ctx[c_ids[0]];
    // ....
    // do some drawing on the ctx. 
    // the canvas is currently in the dom, so you will see the changes
    // ...

    els[0].canv_id = c_ids[2]; 
    // Note how the original canvas is displaced from els[0]. You can insert it again 
    // to either of the els, and it will still have the drawings.  Note that when you are
    // completely finished with that canvas you *must* do the following:
    m.free_canvas(c_ids[0]);
    // otherwise it will be a memory leak
    
    // If you are using a managed-canvas within a dom-module, you can use declarative binding with canv_id:
    // <managed-canvas canv_id="[[plot_canv_id]]"></managed_canvas>

    </script>

TODO: it may possibly be worth using an object pool, free list type thing.
      it may also be possible to use a WeakMap somehow, to avoid leaks entirely, but I'm 
      not sure how that plays with polymer's bindings.

      It might be nice to reuse the typed-array-manager element here because they both do
      similar things at heart, they just store different data, and the canavas-manger offers
      some extra helper methods on top of the basic storage (ie. create canvas stuff).
