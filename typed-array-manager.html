<!--
CUSTOM ELEMENT: typed-array-manager
BY: DM

Polymer bindings don't work with typed arrays, so if you want to use them you need something more complicated.
This is similar to canvas-manager, though there is no managed-array element here (c.g. managed-canvas).

Create at least one instance of the element and then you can access the singleton at window.typed_array_manager.

TODO: it might be worth implementing this as a wrapper around a WeakMap, where the keys are (have to be) objects
rather than strings.  This would mean we don't have to worry about garbage collection and memory leaks...although
it makes it harder for the main thread to communicate with workers unless it maintains a basic version of the map,
using normal keys...and then you would need to do manual garbage collection again...so maybe it's not worth it.
